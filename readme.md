## Bootsass
### Starter files to get you up and running with Bootstrap 3 and SASS

__Install__
There are 3 branches.

- master (uses grunt)
- gulp-bower (take a guess)
- prepros (uses [prepros.io](http://prepros.io) to compile SASS)

Choose a branch based on your preferred workflow then clone the repo to get started.
`components.html' has the Bootstrap kitchen sink so you can edit the Bootstrap variables and see how your components will look.
